				    Atlas has a weight to carry & so do I
				<br>Pressure & Gravity making me comply
				<br>
				<br>Considered a blessing as well as a curse
				<br>Since when did doing my best make me feel worse
				<br>
				<br>A simple task, I overcomplicate
				<br>Thoughts going too fast for my hands to create
				<br>
				<br>Praise is appreciated every now and then
				<br>Until people expect the best again and again
				<br>
				<br>A bit suffocating I must admit
				<br>But I endure, apologies to my health, as I always risk it
				<br>
				<br>I can't turn back now, I've come too far
				<br>Pushing out the best I can manage, never accepted subpar
				<br>
				<br>Unfinished work, files untouched, this alone I cannot leave
				<br>So in the midst of this, all I can do,
				<br> is Breathe.
