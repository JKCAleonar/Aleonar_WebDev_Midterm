				    <em><strong>Atlas</strong></em> has a weight to carry & so do <em><strong>I</strong></em>
				<br>Pressure & Gravity making me comply
				<br>
				<br>Considered a <em>blessing</em> as well as a <em>curse</em>
				<br>Since when did doing my best make me feel worse
				<br>
				<br>A simple task, <em>I overcomplicate</em>
				<br>Thoughts going too fast for my hands to create
				<br>
				<br>Praise is appreciated every now and then
				<br>Until people expect the best <em>again</em> and <em>again</em>
				<br>
				<br>A bit <em>suffocating</em> I must admit
				<br>But I endure, apologies to my health, as I always risk it
				<br>
				<br>I <em>can't</em> turn back now, I've come <em>too far</em>
				<br>Pushing out the best I can manage, never accepted subpar
				<br>
				<br>Unfinished work, files untouched, this alone I cannot leave
				<br>So in the midst of this, all I can do,
				<br> is <strong>Breathe</strong>.
